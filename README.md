ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @flyboy-byte
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in old retro computers, programming in general, and security, such as hacking and networking...
ğŸŒ± Right now I'm trying to learn Java and Arduino C++ and hope to master the wonderful language python soon.
ğŸ“« How to reach me logan07night@gmail.com
 
 ps: I really wish that I could learn the web languages: javascript, html and css but we'll see.
