👋 Hi, I’m @flyboy-byte
👀 I’m interested in old retro computers, programming in general, and security, such as hacking and networking...
🌱 Right now I'm trying to learn Java and Arduino C++ and hope to master the wonderful language python soon.
🌐 Lately I started working on a website of my own, lneltro.us, using html and, hopefully soon, css.
