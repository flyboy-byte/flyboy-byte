#### 👋 Hi, I’m @flyboy-byte<br>
👀 I’m interested in old retro computers, 
programming in general, and security, such 
as hacking and networking...<br>
🌱 Right now I'm trying to learn Java and 
Arduino C++ and hope to master the wonderful 
language python soon.<br>
🌐 Lately I started working on a website 
of my own, [lneletro.us](http://www.lneletro.us), using html and, 
hopefully soon, css.<br>
