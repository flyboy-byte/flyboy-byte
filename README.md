I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for creating and solving problems. My interests and skills include 3D printing, hobby electronics, and software development, where I enjoy designing and building physical objects using 3D printing technology and experimenting with circuit design and microcontroller programming to create interactive projects. As for software development, I am expanding my knowledge with primary focus on Bash, C++, and HTML, and using Linux as my primary development environment as well as my daily driven os. In addition, I have interests in Ham radio, cyber-security, and retro computing, such as the Apple II, which I actively pursue and learn about in my free time.
